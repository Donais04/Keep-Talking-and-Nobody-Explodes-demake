Hello! I am Mitchell Donais, and I made this program! I'm so glad you have taken the time to look at this!

Project title: Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes Java Demake

Project description: this is a demake of the game Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes on steam 
(https://store.steampowered.com/app/341800/Keep_Talking_and_Nobody_Explodes/). I started this project back in 
junior year of high school!

How to play: If you have a friend, this game is much more fun. One of you will take the role of diffuser,
and the other will take the role of expert. The diffuser gets to look at the bomb, but not the instructions
on how to diffuse it, while the expert gets to look at the instructions on how to diffue the bomb, but 
not the bomb itself. To find instructions on how to diffuse it, look to https://www.bombmanual.com/.

What is a bomb: a bomb has a few main attributes: its batteries, its serial number (containing 8 numbers and letters),
its indicators (a combination of 3 letters, then a light that's either on or off), a bunch of various ports, the timer 
(like any good explosive device should have), the amount of strikes (the amount of times you can make an error), 
and the modules (the things you actually have to solve)

How to use: there are a few bombs pre-made in the bombSeeds.txt file. Any bomb that starts with a number, colon, then 
another number is one I took directly from the game. I decided to recreate exactly half of them, which is why the number
jumps two every time. If you decide to create a bomb and play it, it will not be saved to that file, but if you decide to 
create a bomb and save it, it will be added to that file for you to be able to play again whenever you'd like. 

How to use back button: when you are in a module and want to escape back to the bomb, you may press the back button to exit.

Warnings: keypad kinda sucks, sorry about that.
